Design Concepts

I kept my design simple. I want it to look clean and more modern with color. I really like some of the bold colors in the sites I listed below.  I want to use bigger fonts. Some of the example CSS Zen sites had really small font which I didn't like, thought it was hard to see.  I like not having the blocks in the two columns I created line up exactly horizontally.  I like them being off a little from each other so it's not too symmetrical. I think this helps it look more modern too.


I want the site to be easy to look at and navigate.  I liked keeping it simple so it's not too busy looking and purposefully created spacing to include negative space.  I don't want the user to be distracted or turned-off by a busy full page.  I think using bolder colors and cool fonts will make it more exciting looking, hopefully getting a user excited to try this project themselves.  


These are the examples I liked the most: http://www.csszengarden.com/217/, http://www.csszengarden.com/221/, http://www.csszengarden.com/218/, and http://www.csszengarden.com/097/.  

I really liked the first site listed, the colors, layout, and how you can see through the color blocks to the blocks behind them. I like that the fonts are big and easy to read. The second site also had cool colors and a neat layout. I like that in both these sites, the blocks of information do not line up exactly, not too matchy, makes the site more interesting. The fonts and borders are what I like in the third site, and the list of the  designs.  The fourth site has more of a simple block layout that I liked too.
