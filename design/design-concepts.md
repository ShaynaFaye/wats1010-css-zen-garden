Design Concepts

Write some text about my overall design concept and/or theme

Talk about how I hope to affect/impact my users with the style.

Include links to inspirational designs I've looked at.

These are the examples I liked the most: http://www.csszengarden.com/217/, http://www.csszengarden.com/221/, http://www.csszengarden.com/218/, and http://www.csszengarden.com/097/.  I really liked the first site listed, the colors, layout, and how you can see through the color blocks to the blocks behind them. I like that the fonts are big and easy to read. The second site also had cool colors and a neat layout. I like that in both these sites, the blocks of information do not line up exactly, not too mathcy. Makes the site more interesting to look at. The fonts and borders are what I like in the third site, and the list of the other designs.  The fourth site has more of the block layout that I went for
